# HotPotato (Fabric mod)

## Introduction

_This is a very simple mod made for [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/)._

The goal of this plugin is to emulate the "Hot Potato" game.

There is no creating recipe for the item, it must be given using the `/give` command or obtained in Creative Mode. The player starting with the **Hot Potato** item has the task of secretly trying to pass it to another player. When the potato is passed, an announcement is broadcast, letting everyone know who passed it to who. Then the cycle continues.
